I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Washington, Seattle. I am advised by Professor [Adriana Schulz](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~adriana/). I am a part of Graphics and Imaging Laboratory Lab ([GRAIL](https://grail.cs.washington.edu/)).

My interests are in the domain of computational design and fabrication, where we use computational tools to complement advanced manufacturing techniques, like CNC machines, knitting machines, and 3D printing, to build novel physical artifacts.
