      year: 2020 - 2022
      description:
        - key: "Lead author - Computational Design of Passive Grippers"
          value: Developed an algorithm to design a passive gripper, one that does not exert force on an object, and find a valid robot trajectory to grab any given object. The gripper can be 3D printed and mounted on the robot arm to enable assembly lines to quickly and easily be re-purposed to produce new products in need.
        - key: "Contribution - Knitting Simulation"
          value: Implemented a knitted cloth simulator in C++, which is typically used in animations and games. The simulator works at the yarn level, providing matching results with real knitted clothes. Implemented a conversion pipeline for transforming a 3D stitch mesh model to a collection of yarn curves to be used with the cloth simulator.
