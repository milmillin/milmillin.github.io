      year: 2020 - 2022
      description:
        - key: "Lead author - Computational Design of Passive Grippers"
          value: Developed an algorithm to design a passive gripper, one that does not exert force on an object, and find a valid robot trajectory to grab any given object. The gripper can be 3D printed and mounted on the robot arm to enable assembly lines to quickly and easily be re-purposed to produce new products in need.
        - key: "Contribution - Knitting Simulation"
          value: Implemented a knitted cloth simulator in C++, which is typically used in animations and games. The simulator works at the yarn level, providing matching results with real knitted clothes. Implemented a conversion pipeline for transforming a 3D stitch mesh model to a collection of yarn curves to be used with the cloth simulator.

    - title: Emnote â€” Handwritten Note-taking Application
      year: 2018 - Present
      description_nl:
        Designed and implemented a handwritten note-taking app for Windows, a OneNote alternative with pages and nice PDF
        imports. The app was implemented in C#, XAML, and UWP; and is available at https://emnote.app and at the
        Microsoft Store with 5,000+ downloads.
    - title: Loop Termination Branch Predictor for RISC-V Processor
      year: 2021
      description_nl:
        Implemented the Loop Termination Buffer and integrated with BlackParrot, an open source multicore RISC-V processor.
        The buffer correctly predicts the end of the inner for-loops with constant number of iterations and is able to improve the
        overall branch prediction accuracy.
    - title: Alumni Directory Website
      year: 2020
      description_nl:
        Designed and developed an alumni directory website for high school using React and Firebase. Alums can enter their
        education and career in the website. Current students can custom search alums with specific attributes that best suit their
        goals. The site is available at kvis-alumni.web.app.
    - title: 5-Stage Pipelined RISC-V 32I Processor
      year: 2021
      description_nl:
        Implemented from scratch a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V 32I Processor in SystemVerilog. The implementation was tested on
        an FPGA and was able to run arbitrary C code compiled to RISC-V binaries.
    - title: Automatic Text Summarizer
      year: 2016
      description_nl:
        Developed a deep neural network model that automatically summarizes documents into a single paragraph using Python.
        The model uses features such as word frequency, position, and part of speech to determine the importance of a sentence.
        It helped screening research papers during my high school.
