### Why built Jummify?

I have used (classic) Memrise for more than five years to learn Korean words, and I found it to be the the most effective compared to other services. It's unfortunate to see it get shut down [read more](https://www.memrise.com/blog/changes-to-the-memrise-app), but I very much respect the decisions of the company. Many alternatives to Memrise exist, but they are either not as effective or not as user-friendly. Some of them start to incorporate AI-generated content or AI agents in their services, which is not what everybody wants.

Jummify, therefore, was built with these following goals in mind:

- The app should be user-friendly, mobile-friendly, and intuitive.
- The app uses research-based spaced repetition algorithms to learn vocabulary.
- The app provides no AI-generated content or AI agents and retains community-driven content.
